#### Notes:

* VN007 can only use firmware starting with X21, and VN007+ can only use firmware starting with X21G!
* This project only provides publicly available firmware for VN007 and VN007+ devices **sold in the mainland of China.**
* **Do not upgrade/downgrade between VN007 1.X and 3.X freely!!!**
* **VN007+ cannot safely revert to an older version after upgrading to version 1.15.1 or higher!!!**
* It is strongly recommended to use a Chromium-based browser when uploading firmware upgrade packages for optimal compatibility!
* For VN007+, it is highly recommended to use the `VN007+_1.10.10` firmware!
* Flashing firmware carries certain risks, and all risks arising from using the firmware provided by this project are borne by you.
* This project is unofficial. Due to the absence of official channels, the above firmware is collected and provided by an individual user.
* Although ZLT (Tongze) officials continue to maintain and update the device firmware, I can no longer maintain this project. Future updates will be pushed by the official channel, and no further public firmware packages will be provided.
